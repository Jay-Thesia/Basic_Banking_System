# Basic_Banking_System

Hello folks,

I would be elated that I have made the Basic Banking System a simple Dynamic Website has the following specification:

1. Start with creating a dummy database using Mysql/MongoDB, In which we contain customers table will have basic field such as name, email, current balance, etc.
2. Flow: Home Page>View all customers > Select and view one customer> Transfer Money > Select customer to transfer to >View all customer
3. download Index.html with GitHub code file and feel free to make changes.

	Happy Coding :)))))))
